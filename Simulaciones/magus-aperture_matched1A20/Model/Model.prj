[Comment]
Project name:  Aperture-matched waveguide-fed pyramidal horn

Date created: 12/02/2009

Geometry:
Four curves representing the horn corners are created. Faces are created by lofting between the curves.
The metal is set to be infinitely thin.

General:
Multiple far-field monitors are created by a macro and the boresight gain across the frequency band is plotted using template-based postprocessing. The number of points is set with the "num_ff_monitors" variable.

Two planes of symmetry are used.
